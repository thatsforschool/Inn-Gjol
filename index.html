        <h1>Gjøl Kro</h1>
        <p>
          A place where groups both large and small can enjoy a meal and also
          guests who just want to drink a cold beer in the bar area. It’s not
          just for town locals, but also for guests from out of town. We focus
          on local raw goods and our food is traditional Danish meals with a
          modern twist

        <p>
          The inn shouldn’t be seen as ”old school”, quite the opposite. We want
          to bring it up to the modern standard of culinary experiences in
          restaurants, also for large groups. We focus on local raw goods and
          our food is traditional Danish meals with a modern twist.

        <p>
          The historical inn dates all the way back to 1851, when it had a
          thatch roof and served as the town’s gathering point. Unfortunately,
          it burned down around 1900 and was rebuild the year after, giving it
          its current form with stepped gables. The gables are easily seen from
          the Limfjord and can be used as a sort of sea mark that tells sailors
          that they have arrived in Gjøl.

        <p>
          We want Gjøl Kro to be a place for everyone and fill the inn with
          plenty of humour and laughter. We offer group bookings, à la carte in
          the restaurant and drinks in the bar area.

        <h2><a href="staff.html">Meet the Staff</a></h2>
        <p>
          Our vision is for the inn to once again become an integrated part of
          the local community, but also a ”hyggelig”atmosphere guests from all
          of Nordjylland will want to be part of. Meet the people that add up to
          the experience.
