        <h1>Gjøl Kro</h1>
        <p>A place where groups both large and small can enjoy a meal and also guests who just want to drink a cold beer in the bar area. It’s not just for town locals, but also for guests from out of town. We focus on local raw goods and our food is traditional Danish meals with a modern twist</p>

        <h2>Menu</h2>
        <p>The inn shouldn’t be seen as ”old school”, quite the opposite. We want to bring it up to the modern standard of culinary experiences in restaurants, also for large groups. We focus on local raw goods and our food is traditional Danish meals with a modern twist.</p>

        <h2><a href=".html">Inn Gjøl</a></h2>
        <p>The historical inn dates all the way back to 1851, when it had a thatch roof and served as the town’s gathering point. Unfortunately, it burned down around 1900 and was rebuild the year after, giving it its current form with stepped gables. The gables are easily seen from the Limfjord and can be used as a sort of sea mark that tells sailors that they have arrived in Gjøl. </p>

        <h2><a href=".html">Party Venue</a></h2>
        <p>We want Gjøl Kro to be a place for everyone and fill the inn with plenty of humour and laughter. We offer group bookings, à la carte in the restaurant and drinks in the bar area.</p>

        <h2><a href=".html">Meet the Stuff</a></h2>
        <p>Our vision is for the inn to once again become an integrated part of the local community, but also a ”hyggelig”atmosphere guests from all of Nordjylland will want to be part of. Meet the people that add up to the experience.</p>
